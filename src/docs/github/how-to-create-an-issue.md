## Step 4: Create a New Issue

1. On the "Issues" page, click the green "New Issue" button.

## Step 5: Fill in the Issue Details

1. In the "Title" field, provide a concise and descriptive title for the issue.
2. In the "Comment" field, describe the issue in detail. Include information like what the problem is, how to reproduce it, and any other relevant details.
3. In the "Assignees" field (optional), you could assign it directly for you or leave it in blank and let other developer do it.
4. In the "Labels" field, assign what is this ticket related. Most use probably feature, bug or Three.
